# Pigeonhole Principle from Proofs

## General Form

Consider placing kn + m objects (where 0 < m â‰¤ n) into n boxes. The
Pigeonhole Principle states that at least one box will contain k + 1
objects.

## Explanation

Think of the pigeons as individuals and the pigeonholes as distinct
properties or labels. By assigning these individuals to specific
properties, we can abstractly demonstrate the principle's
applicability.
