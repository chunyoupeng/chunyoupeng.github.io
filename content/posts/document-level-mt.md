# Problem

While the improvement of the machine translation(MT) recently, the ablitiy to automatically translate literary text is limited. 


# Assumption in prior work



# Insight

They leverage large pretrained language models to improve literary MT and introduce their large-scale dataset PAR3.

# Technical overview

## The PAR 3 Dataset: Parallel Paragraph-Level Paraphrases

PAR 3 was curated in four stages: selec-tion of source texts, machine translation of source texts, paragraph alignment, and final filtering. 

它至少有两种以上的人工翻译可以对照，并且有一个Google翻译本。人工翻译和Google翻译之间需要对齐。并且把短的句子删掉。
