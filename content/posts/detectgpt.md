# Problem

目前，使用ai生成文本已经非常常见了。但是目前并没有什么好的方法可以很好的检测ai生成的文本。
# Assumption in prior work

Prior work trains a second model to detect machine-gennerated text, but it may overfit the topic.

# Insight

They consider the zero-shot version of machine-generated text detection by evaluating the average per-token log probability of the generated text and thresholding.


# Technical overview

# Proof

# Impact
