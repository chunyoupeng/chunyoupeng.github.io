# What is math?

> Math runs on definitions.

Math is a way to research a object's different aspects. For a car, if you want to count the number, it is one. if you want to know how many wheels it has, it is four. So in the same object, you will get different "math". 

Definition is to give something a name. it is the first layer of [[https://chunyoupeng.github.io/posts/abstraction/][abstract]]. Once you have the name, you can build things at a higer level.
