# What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is a process by which general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal (real or concrete) signifiers, first principles, or other methods.

# Abstraction in Mathematics

I once dwelled on a problem repeatedly, a problem that had been considered many times before. I've come to realize that such rumination is unproductive. This revelation came when I acknowledged my struggle with the skill of abstraction.

# Building Your Foundation

I have developed a mental model for understanding abstraction, as illustrated in Figure 1 below. To grasp the essence of abstraction, one must first deeply understand the foundational principles. It's crucial to question why certain things are accepted as true and others are not. What makes these principles reasonable? Belief in the validity of these foundational truths is the first step toward building your own formulas.

> The Abstract Layer

The core insight here is that once your foundation and formulas are established, you should focus on the layer directly beneath your current level of work, avoiding any further contemplation of the foundational principles. Accept these truths as given; this acceptance will conserve your time and energy, enabling you to construct more complex and elegant structures based on the previous layers.

Remember, the layers of abstraction will continue to expand indefinitely. You will create innovations that rely on the layer immediately beneath them. This approach is not just efficient; it's transformative.
